## ‚ùì 7. User Experience Q&A

**Q: How should the app handle range playback for memorization purposes?**
A: The app plays the selected range once without automatic looping. Users can manually replay if needed. This prevents overwhelming beginners while allowing focused memorization sessions.

**Q: What's the optimal pause timing between Arabic and translation audio?**
A: Within each verse, there's a 300ms pause between Arabic recitation and its translation. Between verses, there's a 500ms pause between the previous verse's translation and the next verse's Arabic, giving users time to process and transition.

**Q: Should users preview different reciters before selection?**
A: For MVP simplicity, a dropdown list of reciters is sufficient. Previewing functionality can be considered for future versions based on user feedback.

**Q: Which translation languages should be prioritized for MVP?**
A: Starting with English, Tamil, and Urdu covers a significant portion of non-Arabic speaking Muslims globally and provides good market validation.

**Q: How should the app handle user preferences across sessions?**
A: The app remembers the user's last-used configuration (reciter, language, speed) and pre-populates these settings when selecting new surahs, streamlining the experience for regular users.

**Q: How should favorite ranges be displayed and managed?**
A: Favorites display as "Surah X: Ayah Y-Z" format with reciter and translation language info. No custom naming needed for MVP - keeping it simple and functional.

**Q: Should there be progress tracking for memorization?**
A: Not for MVP. The focus is on providing a clean, functional audio experience. Progress tracking features can be evaluated for future versions based on user needs.
